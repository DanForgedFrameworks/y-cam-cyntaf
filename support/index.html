          <h1>Support and contact</h1>

          <p>
            Y Cam Cyntaf is designed to be low-pressure and supportive.
            If something is not working, or you are unsure what to do next,
            you do not need to struggle on your own.
          </p>

          <!-- COURSE SUPPORT -->
          <h2>Course support</h2>
          <p>
            For anything related to the course itself, your first point of contact is your
            facilitator and your fellow learners.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Use your course WhatsApp group to ask questions or check understanding.</li>
            <li>Reach out to your facilitator during or after live sessions.</li>
            <li>Share experiences with your peers – you are not the only one learning.</li>
          </ul>
