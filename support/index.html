          This page is here to help you feel supported during the course.
          You do not need to figure everything out on your own.
        </p>

        <div class="tip-box" style="margin-top:1rem;">
          <strong>Course support:</strong> If you have a question about the course, or you are unsure what to do next,
          reach out through your WhatsApp group. Your facilitator, your peers, and your fellow Cam Cyntafer(s) are part of the support.
