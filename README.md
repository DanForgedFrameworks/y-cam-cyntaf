# Y Cam Cyntaf – Digital Learning Hub

This repository hosts the digital learning hub for **Y Cam Cyntaf**, a gentle, community-based Welsh language course delivered by Tidy Butt.

The site is designed to support live sessions with low-pressure digital activities that help learners feel welcomed, confident, and connected — without tests, grades, or performance expectations.

## 🌱 What is Y Cam Cyntaf?

Y Cam Cyntaf means *“The First Step”*.

It is a beginner-friendly introduction to Welsh that prioritises:
- Confidence over correctness  
- Belonging over performance  
- Small, realistic steps over formal assessment  

Learners are encouraged to listen, notice, try a few words, and celebrate progress in ways that suit their energy and wellbeing.

## 🧠 How the digital hub is used

This site supports the course by providing:
- Orientation materials to reduce pressure before Session 1  
- Session pages with a consistent structure:
  - Get Ready  
  - Live session  
  - After the session  
  - Optional curiosity threads  
- Optional printable and offline-friendly resources  
- A **private “Distance Travelled” confidence check-in** that learners can use at the start and end of the course

If learners have limited time or energy, completing just the **Get Ready** step is always enough.

## 🔒 Privacy and data approach

The digital hub is intentionally low-risk and privacy-first.

- No accounts or logins are required  
- Learner reflections are not graded or assessed  
- The Distance Travelled check-in is private by default  
- Any data sharing is optional, anonymous, and learner-controlled  

This approach supports psychological safety and reduces barriers to participation.
