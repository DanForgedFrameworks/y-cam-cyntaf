            There will be a short video here from Matt, the founder of Tidy Butt. He will welcome you to Y Cam Cyntaf, explain why the course exists, and reassure you that this is about connection, not tests or grades.

        These resources help you get the most from the live sessions and support shared learning in the room. If you can, try to engage with the steps before each session so you and your peers can get more from the activities together.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your time or energy is low, focus on <strong>Get Ready</strong> only. That is enough to help you arrive feeling more confident and connected.
