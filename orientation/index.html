          <p>
            This short orientation sits alongside Session 1. It is here to lower the pressure and show you how everything works
            before you step into the room.

              These resources are here to help you get the most from the live sessions and to support shared learning in the room.
              They help everyone arrive prepared, so if you are not on the same page, you are at least in the same book.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aim to engage with the resources as much as you can. They benefit you and your peers, and they help the live sessions
              feel more comfortable and more connected.
            </p>

              If your time or energy is low, just complete the <strong>Get Ready</strong> steps for Session 1. That is more than enough
              to get started.
