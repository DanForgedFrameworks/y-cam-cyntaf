    <h1>Orientation</h1>
    <p>This short orientation sits alongside Session 1. It is here to lower the pressure and show you how everything works before you step into the room.</p>

    <h2>Welcome video from Matt (coming soon)</h2>
    <p>
      There will be a short video here from Matt, the founder of Tidy Butt. He will welcome you to Y Cam Cyntaf, explain why the course exists,
      and reassure you that this is about connection, not tests or grades.
    </p>

    <h2>What Y Cam Cyntaf is (and is not)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A gentle first step into Welsh, with friendly support from Tidy Butt and the group.</li>
      <li>A space to listen, notice, try a few words, and celebrate small wins together.</li>
      <li><strong>Not</strong> an exam course or a perfect grammar class. Mistakes are expected and welcome.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How learning will happen</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Short digital “Get Ready” activities between sessions.</li>
      <li>Low-pressure live sessions every fortnight, with games, stories, and wellbeing check-ins.</li>
      <li>Light social “homework”, small actions you can try in day-to-day life if you have the energy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pressure, mistakes, and participation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You choose how much you join in on any given day.</li>
      <li>You can listen quietly, speak when you feel ready, or just try one word.</li>
      <li>Mistakes are treated as part of learning, and often part of the laughter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Digital resources and print-friendly backups</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each session has a Get Ready → Live session → After the session structure.</li>
      <li>You can use this hub on your phone or laptop, or print pages as PDFs using your browser.</li>
      <li>The Downloads area will grow with handouts, phrase sheets, and curiosity prompts as the course runs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Curiosity threads</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Optional “rabbit holes” linked to Welsh nature, place-names, or mythology.</li>
      <li>There is no expectation to finish them. They are there to spark interest and give you something fun to chat about in Welsh.</li>
      <li>You will see them labelled as Curiosity thread in the session cards.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When you are ready, head to Session 1 and complete the Get Ready activities. If your time or energy is low, doing just that is more than enough.
